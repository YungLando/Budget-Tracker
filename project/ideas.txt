ideas
taxes
api for bank account
api for digital subscriptions
see what category causes most expenses
graph for spending per month
could use a pie chart where if you hover over it shows category percentages
stock market tracker that incorporates money gained/lossed from market
have a monthly accrue based off my estimated budget, and then how much i actually spent
